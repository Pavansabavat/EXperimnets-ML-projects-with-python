#  Spotify  Music   Recommendation System 
Step 1: Create a Spotify Account
For a Spotify developer account, you need an account at Spotify. If you don’t use Spotify, create an account. You don’t need to purchase any subscription to get your credentials. Once you have created an account at Spotify (or you already have one) log in to your account from your web browser.

Step 2: Go to Your Spotify Developer Dashboard
Once you have created an account at Spotify, you need to log in to your Spotify developer dashboard. Here’s the link to the dashboard. As you will be using this developer account for the first time, sign the agreement and verify your email. After these steps, we can move to the next step.

Step 3: Create An App
Once you have verified an email, you will see an option to create an app in your dashboard

Step 5: Copy Your Client ID and Client Secret
After filling in the app description, you will be redirected to your id and password. If you click “View client secret”, you will see your password. Copy your credentials so that you can use them while building a Music Recommendation System using Python.
